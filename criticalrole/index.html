		<p>Well, I'm glad you asked!  <a title="Dungeons & Dragons" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dungeons_%26_Dragons">Dungeons & Dragons</a> is a tabletop role-playing game wherein a group of players each make up a character they want to play and then the group goes on adventures together, often in a Tolkein-esque universe.  In fact some of the races and classes are often those you find in the Lord of the Rings world:  dwarves, elves, halflings, humans, orcs, and goblins who are rangers, fighters, wizards, druids, etc.</p>
		<p><a title="Critical Role" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Role">Critical Role</a> is "a group of nerdy-ass voice actors who get together to play Dungeons & Dragons" and stream it online for others to watch.  Sound crazy?  Maybe it is but it's gathered a cult following since it first went live on March 12, 2015 and many credit this rag-tag group with Dungeons & Dragons' huge resurgence in popularity in recent years.</p>
		<p>Critical Role streams on <a title="Twitch" href="http://www.twitch.tv/criticalrole">Twitch</a>, with episodes made available on Youtube the following week.
